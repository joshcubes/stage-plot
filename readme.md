# Stage Plot Designer

**Stage Plot Designer** is a web-based interactive tool that lets you easily create stage plots for bands, events, theatre productions, or any other scenario where a precise stage layout is needed. Its intuitive drag-and-drop interface and customizable settings make designing an optimal stage arrangement effortless.

## Features

- **Item Library**  
  On the left sidebar, you'll find a library of predefined items. Simply drag your chosen item into the main canvas, where you can move, scale, rotate, and modify it to fit your layout.

- **Interactive Canvas**  
  Place items with precision using grid and snapping features, add labels for clarity, and arrange your stage diagram exactly as you need it.

- **Project Import & Export**  
  Easily export your stage plot as a JSON file and import it back later for further editing or sharing with others.

- **Customizable Library**  
  Enhance the item library by editing the `items.txt` file. To add new items, include the corresponding image files in the `images` folder (make sure the image names match the entries in `items.txt`).

## Installation & Usage
